"""Play policy: cards the bot should NOT cast.

Two reasons a card lands here:
  * it triggers an in-resolution card chooser the bot cannot click through
    (would stall the game), or
  * it is a reactive card with no good proactive line, so casting it on our own
    turn just wastes it (STRATEGIC_SKIP_GRP_IDS).

Layers, manual-first:
  1. UNSUPPORTED_GRP_IDS / STRATEGIC_SKIP_GRP_IDS -- exact grpIds, always block.
  2. oracle-text patterns -- catch the common stall phrasings automatically.
