Free, open-source Magic the Gathering Arena (MTGA) bot for automating daily quests, daily wins, and account switching. Burning Lotus runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux without code injection or subscriptions. Built in Python with a graphical UI, no command-line knowledge required.

Feel free to inspect the code, request a feature, or report a bug via GitHub Issues or open a pull request. Discord: https://discord.gg/49j93Jz6v

## Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11, macOS 12+, or Linux (X11 or Wayland; tested on Debian and CachyOS)
- **Python**: 3.10+
- **MTG Arena**: installed and running
  - Windows: Steam or Wizards installer
  - macOS: Crossover or compatible Wine layer
  - Linux: Wine/Proton via Steam or Lutris

Python dependencies are installed automatically by the launcher scripts:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pyautogui` | Mouse/keyboard input (default backend) |
| `pynput` | Global input listener (hotkeys, macro recording) |
| `mss` | Fast screen capture |
| `opencv-python` | Template matching |
| `Pillow` | UI rendering |
| `numpy` | Numerical arrays (shared data format between mss and OpenCV) |

### Required MTGA settings (all platforms)

- `Options -> View Account -> Detailed Logs (Plugin Support)`: **ON** *(required — the bot reads `Player.log` as its primary state source)*
- `Options -> Video -> Language`: **English**
- `Options -> Video -> Display Mode`: **Windowed**
- `Options -> Video -> Resolution`: **any exact 16:9 windowed size**
- OS display scaling: **any (the bot converts coordinates for scaled displays)**

## Quick Start

Each platform has its own launcher script — named after the platform — that creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, and starts the UI:

| Platform | Launcher |
|---|---|
| Windows | `start_windows.bat` |
| macOS | `start_macos.command` |
| Linux | `start_linux.sh` |

### Windows

1. Install Python 3.10+ from python.org (tick "Add python.exe to PATH").
2. Double-click `start_windows.bat`.

### macOS

1. Install Python 3.13 (recommended):
   - python.org installer, **or**
   - `brew install python@3.13 python-tk@3.13`
2. Optional preflight check: `./doctor_macos.command`
3. Double-click `start_macos.command` (or run `./start_macos.command` in Terminal).
4. Grant permissions to the Terminal app **and** the Python binary inside `.venv-macos`:
   - `System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility`
   - `System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Screen Recording`

### Linux

1. Install Python 3.10+ and OS-level packages:

   | Purpose | Arch / CachyOS | Debian / Ubuntu | Fedora | openSUSE |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | tkinter UI | `tk` | `python3-tk` | `python3-tkinter` | `python3-tk` |
   | MTGA window detection | `xorg-xwininfo` | `x11-utils` | `xorg-x11-utils` | `xwininfo` |
   | Screenshot (KDE) | `spectacle` | `kde-spectacle` | `spectacle` | `spectacle` |
   | Screenshot (GNOME) | `gnome-screenshot` | `gnome-screenshot` | `gnome-screenshot` | `gnome-screenshot` |
   | Screenshot (wlroots/Sway/Hyprland) | `grim` | `grim` | `grim` | `grim` |
   | Screenshot (X11 fallback) | `scrot` | `scrot` | `scrot` | `scrot` |

   The launcher warns if any required package is missing and prints the exact install command for your distro.

2. Run `./start_linux.sh`.

3. MTGA must run through Wine/Proton (Steam or Lutris). Under Wayland it goes through XWayland automatically.

### Manual start (any platform)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\pip
.venv/bin/python ui.py                       # Windows: .venv\Scripts\python ui.py
```

### Updates

The bot checks GitHub for a newer version on startup and, when one is found, a dialog offers to install it and restarts the bot automatically. There are two channels, picked automatically:

- **Git installs** (started from a `git clone` of this repository): the check works off git commit history (not the version number below), only fetches when the remote is actually ahead of local, and installs via a fast-forward `git pull`. If you have local, uncommitted changes to *tracked* files in the bot folder, the update is aborted rather than overwriting them, and the dialog lists which file(s) are affected. Untracked files (your venv, notes, …) never block an update.
- **ZIP / website installs** (no `.git` folder): the bot compares its local `version.py` against the one on the `main` branch at GitHub. If `main` has a newer version, it downloads the branch archive and overlays it onto the install folder. The archive only contains tracked source files, so user data (`runtime/`, `Accounts/`, `.venv/`, `.venv-macos/`, `credentials.txt`, …) is never touched. Executable bits on the launcher scripts are preserved, so `start_macos.command` / `start_linux.sh` stay double-clickable after an update.

Either check is skipped when there's no network access. Every check writes its outcome (up to date, update available, or why it was skipped) to `bot.log`, so a missing update dialog can be diagnosed afterwards. Dependencies from `requirements.txt` are reinstalled automatically if they changed as part of the update.

The app's current version (`1.3.2`, sourced from `version.py`) is shown in **Settings**, above the Manage Accounts button.

## Configuration

### Input backend

The bot auto-selects the best available input backend per platform:

| Platform | Default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `pyautogui` | `ydotool` (if installed), then `pynput` |
| macOS | `pyautogui` | `pynput` |
| Windows | `pynput` | — |

Override via environment variable: `MTGA_BOT_INPUT_BACKEND=auto|pyautogui|pynput|ydotool|null`

`ydotool` requires `ydotoold` daemon to be running and is recommended for Linux Wayland sessions.

Typing (account e-mail and password during an account switch) always goes through `pynput`, even on the `pyautogui` backend: `pyautogui` types by posting hardcoded **US**-layout key codes, which the OS re-interprets against the layout that is actually active. On a German QWERTZ keyboard that turned `@` into `"`, swapped y/z and mangled `-`/`_`, so logins failed with no visible reason. `pynput` inserts the literal character and is therefore layout-independent.

### Calibration (optional)

The bot locates the MTGA window automatically on startup — no manual calibration needed in most cases.

Use **Settings → Calibrate** only if the bot repeatedly fails to click the right spots. Calibration captures 1920x1080-relative coordinates and maps them to the actual window position at runtime.

## Features

### Account Switching

Accounts are stored as folders under `Accounts/` (gitignored by default):

```
Accounts/
  MyAccount/
    credentials.json   →   { "MyAccount": { "email": "...", "pw": "...", "screen_name": "MyName#12345" } }
  AltAccount/
    credentials.json
```

Manage accounts via **Settings → Manage Accounts**. Set a switch timer and play order. When the timer expires and the bot is at a safe screen, it logs out, switches account, and resumes.

Each account has exactly one name: its **Arena Name**, the one Arena shows top-left (`Name#12345`; the digits are optional). It is not a label you choose — the Arena log identifies an account *only* by that name, never by email, so rotation order, per-account gold tracking and the Current/Next display all key off it. Arena Names must be unique; a row without one is rejected on save. Older versions had a second, free-text `Name` field beside it. Manage Accounts now shows such a row under its Arena Name, and pressing **Save Accounts** renames the account for good — the play order and a manual pin are carried across the rename, and the account keeps its folder. A row that never had an Arena Name shows the old label instead, which may not be the Arena one; Manage Accounts points those out when you open it.

#### Current / Next account

While account switching is enabled, the main window shows **Current ACC** (playing now) and **Next ACC** (the account the next switch will log into). Click **Current ACC** to tell the bot which account is open in Arena right now. Use it when you changed account by hand: Arena writes the login only once, so after a while the bot can no longer read it from the log, and a manual pick sets rotation straight again. The pin is dropped automatically on the next switch the bot performs itself, and when the pinned account is renamed or deleted.

A pin is also dropped when Arena logs a login for a *different* account after the pin was set — you changed account by hand again, so the log is newer than your pick. This only happens when that login can be matched to one of your configured accounts by its Arena Name; an unrecognised login never overrides your choice. A pin restored from the previous session additionally yields to a login that is *older* than it, since a restored pin says nothing about who is logged in now — so give every account its Arena Name if you want the bot to correct a stale pin on its own.

**Change Queue** and **Account Switch** in the main menu replace the older click-on-text toggles. Queue mode is locked while the bot runs (changing it mid-run would desync navigation).

Account switching can be toggled on/off live from the main window without restarting the bot, and runs in one of two modes:
- **Time**: switch every N minutes (configurable).
- **Quests**: switch once the configured number of daily quests (measured *absolutely* — completed by the bot or by hand, whichever comes first) and/or daily wins seen this session are reached on that account. With **both** thresholds set the round runs as two passes over the accounts: first every account's daily quests are cleared, then the bot goes round again for the wins. Quests expire at the daily reset and wins do not, so the quests get banked everywhere before the open-ended win grinding starts — under the old rule (both criteria demanded before leaving an account) the last account's quests were only reached after hours of grinding on the first, and a session cut short in between never banked them at all. Wins earned during the quest pass count towards the win pass, so nothing is farmed twice. With only one threshold set there is a single pass and nothing changes. The current pass is in the `SWITCH CHECK` log line as `mode=quests/quests` or `mode=quests/wins`. Once every configured account has completed a round, the bot stops itself instead of cycling back to the first account, and says so in a pop-up so a normal finish isn't mistaken for a freeze. A round covers the accounts in your play order — not every folder under `Accounts/` — and an account whose switch failed is not counted as finished.

Rotation always continues from the account actually logged in, so it never wastes a switch logging back into the same account, and the order stays intact even after a failed switch.

> Fixed in this version: in quests mode the bot could log straight back out of every account without playing a single match. MTGA only writes the quest list on Home, and if no fresh block arrives within the 30-second prime window the read falls back to the newest block already in the log — which is the *previous* session's, written after that session had cleared its quests, so it parses as "0 quests left". With the threshold at 3 ("clear them all") that reads as "this account is finished", and the bot switched again immediately. Measured on 2026-08-22: five accounts, ~30 seconds each, zero matches, heading straight for the end-of-round stop — which now also powers the PC off. The count is still read for deck colours and the UI, but the switch decision now needs proof that the block was logged past this session's (or this switch's) boundary; without it the bot keeps playing and keeps dipping to Home until MTGA logs a real one. `SWITCH CHECK` says `STALE - not this account's own read` while that is the case.

#### Shut down the PC when the round is done

**Manage Accounts** has an opt-in checkbox, **Shut down PC when all accounts are done**, right below the switch settings it depends on. With it ticked, the end-of-round stop described above also powers the machine off — so an overnight run of every account ends with the PC off instead of idling at Home until morning.

It is off by default and saved the moment you click it, not on **Save**. The guard rails matter more than the feature:

- It fires on exactly one event — the controller stopping itself with *all accounts completed this round*, i.e. the end of the last pass (quests only, wins only, or quests-then-wins, depending on which thresholds are set). A manual **Stop**, a crash, a failed switch or a time-mode rotation never reaches it (time mode has no end of round at all, which is why the checkbox says so).
- The shutdown is always **delayed by two minutes** and announced in a pop-up with a **Cancel** button; a zero delay is clamped up rather than honoured, so there is always a window to abort. Cancelling by hand works too: `shutdown /a` on Windows, `shutdown -c` on Linux.
- If arming the shutdown fails, you get a warning telling you to power off yourself, rather than silence — the failure mode of a silent miss is finding the machine still running hours later.
- Works on **Windows and Linux**. Windows gets `shutdown /s /t <seconds>`; Linux hands systemd `shutdown -h +<minutes>` (rounded up, so the delay is never shorter than announced) with `--no-wall`, because the wall broadcast is a separate permission that can be denied where powering off is allowed. An unprivileged Linux call goes through logind/polkit, which grants power-off to the active desktop session without a password — on a headless or locked-down system it can be refused, and then you get the same warning as any other failure to arm. On macOS the setting saves but warns that nothing will power off: its `shutdown` needs root, which a background run cannot get.

A switch that becomes due while a match is running or while matchmaking is in progress is **deferred**, not skipped: it is carried out on the first moment between matches. This also covers the end-of-round stop, which previously could end the session in the middle of a game the bot had just started.

If the logout never reaches the login screen three times in a row — usually a mis-calibrated **Log Out** button or a changed Arena layout — the bot stops attempting to switch for the rest of the session and keeps playing the current account instead of looping through failed logouts. It says so once in `bot.log`, pointing at the calibration.

> Fixed in this version: the **Log Out** click missed the button on every attempt but one, in the whole recorded history. "Log Out" is a centered text link on the Options overlay, and it is found by template match with a coordinate fallback behind it. Both halves were broken. The match passed no scale tolerance, and because the search region is the arena itself — normalized to 1920×1080 — nothing gets rescaled on a 1920-wide client, so only scale 1.0 was ever tried: measured against a live overlay the template scores 0.549 at 1.0 and 0.950 at 1.10, i.e. it could not match at all. The fallback coordinate then pointed at (1716, 851), the legacy bottom-right layout, which is empty background — the link sits at (959, 667). Across the recorded history the image match hit **once** (on a 2048×1152 client) and produced the only successful logout, while the coordinate fallback ran **11 times and produced none**; when the Arena window changed to 1920×1080 the last working path disappeared and switching went from unreliable to impossible, disabling itself after three failures. The match is now scale-tolerant (0.70–1.50) and the fallback coordinate corrected, so both paths agree on the same point.

> Fixed in this version (Linux only): the switch typed a **broken e-mail address** on every login. On X11/XWayland pynput resolves a character to its AltGr level — `@` sits on AltGr+Q on a German layout — and then presses that key *without* AltGr. Measured on 2026-08-23: `a@b` arrived as `aqb`, the address was typed as `…qmail.de`, Arena answered "Invalid email address or password", and the bot — believing it had logged in — span for an hour in `GO_HOME refused` on a login screen, 163 seconds at a time without a single click. Linux now **pastes** instead: the text goes to the clipboard and Ctrl+V puts it in the field, and since Ctrl+V carries no character, no keyboard layout can distort it. Ctrl+A precedes it because `tap_delete()` only deletes forward from the caret and leaves a pre-filled field alone. The clipboard is held by a short-lived helper process (an X selection is served by a live process, and a Tk root that is merely updated once hands out stale content), the text reaches it length-prefixed on **stdin** so no password appears in the process list, and keys go out through `ydotool` — uinput, so neither the layout nor the X server is in the way. If the paste fails, nothing is typed and the switch aborts with an error in the log: a silently wrong password is what cost that hour. **Windows and macOS keep the keystroke path unchanged** — it works there.

> Fixed in this version: after a successful switch, MTGA's post-login announcements could strand the bot. Observed live: "Banned Standard Cards" (an Okay button) followed by a set promo ("The Hobbit — Available Now!"), both covering Home completely — so navigation found no anchor at all and the queue loop spun for two and a half minutes until they were cleared by hand. The bot now clears them, but only once every navigation anchor has already been ruled out, so a dismissal can never steal a click from a real screen. A plain **Okay** is clicked; anything else gets **ESC**, deliberately *not* the promo's own call-to-action, because "Get Started!" opens the Store instead of dismissing. If that ESC merely opened the Options overlay then nothing was covering the screen after all, so it is closed again and the attempt reports no progress — otherwise the overlay would hide Home from the next pass and the dead-end would repeat forever. The Okay search runs at confidence 0.90, not the 0.80 used elsewhere: measured against real screens it scores 0.970 on an actual popup but 0.817 on the event page's orange Play pill and 0.808 on plain Home, so a looser threshold would press Play and start a match with the wrong deck.

> **Known issue:** in quests mode, if a switch becomes due while the bot is on the Starter Deck Duel event page (`game_mode = starter`), the logout sequence can fail to open the Options menu and misclick into the event page instead of logging out. Time-mode switching from Home is unaffected. A fix (navigate to Home before attempting logout) is planned as a follow-up. This is separate from the calibration fix above and still open.

### Gold Tracking

The bot reads each account's real Gold balance from MTGA's own logs and tracks the delta (current balance minus the balance first seen this session) per account — no estimate. Open **Current Session** from the main window to see gold farmed per account (labeled with your account names), alongside games/wins for the session.

Accounts the bot switches into get their baseline read on arrival at Home, before they play, so their earnings are complete.

A balance in MTGA's log does not say which account it belongs to, so only balances written after the session started — and after the most recent account switch — are used. Anything older is ignored rather than guessed at.

> **Known limitation:** the **first** account of a session can show `0` farmed gold. MTGA only reports that account's balance after its first match, at which point the win reward is already included, so that match's earnings can't be measured.

After a switch the bot takes the account's identity from the credentials it just typed — it knows which account it logged in. It used to read that back out of the Arena log instead, but the log has no login event to read: the only thing there is the match-server handshake, written when a match connects. Right after a switch the newest one still belongs to the account just left, so the old name was re-adopted and stuck, and every balance read afterwards — correct in itself, but nameless in the log — was booked against the wrong account. One row could grow implausibly large while its partner sat at `0`. A handshake written *after* the switch still wins, so changing account in Arena by hand is still picked up. A `GOLD_BALANCE_BELOW_BASELINE` line in the log flags a balance below its baseline, which is what a misattribution looks like from the other side.

### Quest-Based Deck Selection

Before its first match at **Start**, and after each account login, the bot automatically rerolls one incomplete **500-gold daily quest** if Arena's fresh quest response says a swap is available. It picks the leftmost visually recognized 500-gold quest, confirms once, accepts either a 500- or 750-gold replacement, and refreshes the quest list and deck colors before continuing. Existing 750-gold quests are left alone. There is no setting to enable, and ordinary between-match refreshes do not spend rerolls; starting during a match defers the check until the first safe return to Home.

The bot verifies Home, the daily-quest tile, and Arena's **Confirm Swap** dialog using captured UI templates, then uses the dialog's fixed, scaled button positions for **OK** and **Cancel**. If clicking an already-active Home tab produces no new quest response, it makes one bounded **Profile → Home** refresh. The same re-entry can obtain the post-swap response, which Arena does not always log immediately. Missing/stale data or an unrecognized dialog skip the attempt. After submission it waits up to 10 seconds for verification and never repeats an uncertain confirmation; an unresolved dialog prevents the queue loop from starting. Quest replacement is not counted as quest completion or gold earned. Outcomes are recorded as `Quest reroll:` in `bot.log`.

Validated against the live English Arena UI at 1280×720 with Windows display scaling at 175%: one 500-gold quest was replaced by a 750-gold quest, the other two quests were preserved, and the refreshed log/cache still showed three incomplete quests. Arena omits `canSwap` when false; only an explicit `true` enables a reroll. The standalone `tools/validate_quest_reroll.py --log-path <Player.log>` inspects controls without input; `--cancel` closes a recognized swap dialog, and `--reroll` runs one real startup check. Use it with the bot stopped; it never queues a match.

On **Start**, and after each account switch, the bot picks a deck based on active quests. Quests are read fresh at start: everything already in Arena's log is ignored and the bot briefly returns to Home to make Arena log the current list (up to 30 seconds; it falls back to the newest entry it has if none arrives). Without this, a quest you re-rolled or finished by hand before pressing Start was read as still active, and the first matches were played on the wrong deck.

Place deck screenshot images in the account folder named by color letters:

- `RG.png`, `WU.png`, `B.png`, `R.png` etc. — matched to quest colors
- `C.png` — used for creature-type quests
- Random fallback if no quest matches

In Starter Deck Duel the deck is additionally re-checked before **every** queue, so when a quest completes mid-session the bot swaps to the colors of the next one instead of finishing the session on the deck it started with. The colors are resolved *after* that check (previously the just-completed quest's deck was replayed for one more match), and the bot verifies the deck chooser actually closed after submitting — a missed swap is now reported in `bot.log` instead of silently farming the wrong colors.

Finding the **Starter Deck Duel** banner no longer depends on it being near the top of the Events list. The bot applies the **In Progress** filter, which normally cuts the list down to the events actually in progress so the banner fits on one page; if it is still not visible, the bot drags the list's scrollbar and re-checks after each step, then rewinds to the top if it never appears.

> Fixed in this version: the **In Progress** filter was never actually applied. Its anchor image had been captured with the filter *selected*, so the lit orange marker dominated the match and it resolved to whichever row was selected — normally **All**. The bot clicked **All**, logged "In Progress filter selected", and then searched the full, unfiltered list. In that list Starter Deck Duel had drifted down far enough to be cut off by the bottom edge of the viewport, and since its image includes the title strip, a half-visible banner matches nothing. The filter is matched on its label text now, which reads the same selected or not.

> Fixed in this version: on brand new accounts (or accounts that have never entered Starter Deck Duel), the event is not listed under **In Progress**. The bot now automatically falls back to the **All** filter if the banner is missing under **In Progress** and waits for the page transition.

> Fixed in this version: on a brand new account the bot reached the deck selection and then opened the deck's **card list** instead of picking a deck, and never found its way out. Measured against a fresh account, the event has *four* screens that a template matcher cannot tell apart — each is a single rounded pill in the bottom-right corner, and it is the same widget every time:
>
> | Screen | Bottom-right button |
> | --- | --- |
> | first entry, event not joined | green **Start** |
> | joined, no deck chosen yet | **Choose Your Deck** (no Play button at all) |
> | the 10-deck chooser grid | **Submit Deck** (plus **View Deck** bottom-left) |
> | deck chosen, ready to queue | orange **Play** |
>
> At the 0.80 confidence the old code used, `event_play.png` matches *all four* of those pills and `submit_deck.PNG` matches all three landing pages, so the bot read the two first-time screens as the normal landing page. It then clicked the current-deck box coordinate — which on the first-time page is the **Inspect Event Decks** thumbnail — and landed in the read-only card list, a screen with no anchor it recognises. The arena-wide Submit-Deck search had the same failure mode from the other side: it matched **View Deck** in the opposite corner, which opens that same card list.
>
> Screens are now identified at 0.90 with two gates that do not rely on the shared pill: the chooser is anchored on the blue **View Deck** button, which exists on no other screen, and the three landing pages additionally require the top-left **Starter Deck Duel** header. That header matters because Home's Play button *is* the event page's Play button — the same widget, matching at 0.90 and even 0.95 — so without it the bot reads Home as the event page and starts clicking event coordinates there. From that, the bot walks the sequence explicitly (Start → Choose Your Deck → grid), never clicks grid coordinates on a screen it has not positively identified as the grid, restricts the Submit-Deck search to the bottom-right corner, and backs out of the card list via the top-left arrow if it ever ends up there.
>
> Also corrected while measuring the live grid: the fixed fallback coordinates for the 10 deck cards were the art's *bottom edge* rather than its center, so that fallback clicked the seam between a card and its name plate and selected nothing.

> Fixed in this version: running the test suite moved the real mouse and clicked. A Controller arms fire-and-forget timers (the card-prompt settle timer among them) that nothing cancels, so tests that built one produced real clicks seconds later, at absolute screen coordinates, on whatever was in front — 231 input events including 77 clicks per full run. Constructing a Controller without naming an input backend now gets an inert one; everything that actually drives Arena names its backend explicitly, so nothing changed for the bot itself. `MTGA_BOT_INPUT_BACKEND` still overrides.

> Note on scrolling: MTGA's event list ignores the mouse wheel entirely, so the bot drags the scrollbar. The step is deliberately small — the bar is about a quarter of its track, so the list moves roughly four times as far as the bar, and a step wider than one banner can jump straight over the one being looked for.

> Fixed in this version: the reward-popup handler mistook the event page's orange **Play** button for a **Claim** button (same corner, same shape). It pressed Play, which started the next match immediately and skipped the deck check — so the bot kept replaying its first deck even after the active quest changed colors. The handler now verifies it is not on the event page before clicking.

### Casting Logic

Combat blocking is enabled by default and can be disabled with `MTGA_COMBAT_BLOCKS=0`. The bot consumes
Arena's legal blocker graph, takes profitable blocks first, and only sacrifices
creatures when needed to survive lethal damage. Trample damage is included in
that survival calculation. Removal targeting also prices Ward before committing:
colored Ward symbols require matching untapped mana sources, and creatures used
for Convoke are not incorrectly counted as mana available for Ward.

The bot maximizes mana usage each turn:
- Prefers the highest-value spell(s) that spend the most mana
- Respects color requirements and discounted costs
- Type priority when CMC is tied: creature → instant → sorcery → enchantment
- Supports Convoke (untapped creatures as mana sources)
- Kicker: the "Cast with Kicker?" chooser is answered automatically (always the plain, non-kicked version for now) so the bot never stalls on it
- The mid-screen "Choose One" overlay — kicker plates, a modal spell's or creature's mode plates (e.g. Apothecary Stomper's enter-the-battlefield choice), and the "sacrifice or pay" buttons — is treated as blocking: while it is up, no other move is dispatched, and the chosen plate is clicked again if the game has not moved on. Previously a single click that failed to register left the dialog open and the bot immediately swept the hand row for its next play behind the overlay, which could not be reached — the match then idled until it was conceded. "Has the game moved on?" is answered by the newest `gameStateId` seen on **any** GRE message, including the timer messages that never reach the merged game state — reading only the merged state made an already-answered dialog look open for another two seconds, and the retry then clicked onto the battlefield behind it
- Client-side "Are You Sure?" confirmations are handled reactively after a failed cast attempt, avoiding speculative screen probes during normal casts
- Decision recovery is guarded against open payment/selection prompts and resumes safely after modal, stack, or scry interruptions
- Ties between otherwise equal casting plans favor lifegain-payoff creatures, so decks built around gaining life develop toward their game plan sooner
- Removal only ever targets creatures still on the battlefield and never redirects a harmful spell at your own board when no valid enemy target exists
- Ward is priced before a target is chosen, not discovered afterwards. A warded creature makes Magic Arena raise a confirmation window that exists only in the client — it is announced nowhere in the game's own messages, so nothing tells the bot it is there. Declining it hands back the same board the bot just looked at, so it picks the same target, and the same window opens again; a single such loop burned six minutes across four turns. Now the ward's cost is read from the card and weighed against the mana left over once the spell is paid for. Affordable, and the bot pays it and kills the creature — refusing to ever pay would make removal useless against the cards it most needs to answer. Unaffordable, and it picks a different target, or holds the spell rather than feeding it to a counter. A target it does back out of is remembered for the rest of the match, so nothing can loop even if the pricing is wrong
- Damage marked on a creature is forgotten when the turn ends, as the rules say it should be. Magic Arena announces damage but never announces its removal — it sends the field once and then simply stops mentioning it — and since the game state is merged from diffs, nothing would otherwise unset it. Left alone the damage accumulated for the rest of the match and every "how much toughness is left" reading drifted below the truth, until creatures that were healthy and attacking looked to the bot like they were already dead. That number decides which creatures removal can kill, which fights are winnable, and which blocks are worth making
- When a card lets you choose which creature to return from the graveyard or exile, the bot ranks candidates by their role in the deck's strategy instead of taking whatever the game offers first
- A card in hand is located by sweeping the mouse across the hand row until Magic Arena logs a hover naming it — the client never says where a card is drawn, so this is the only way to find one. When that sweep failed, all three retries used to re-run the *identical* 1000 px/s pass, each taking exactly 2.0s. Retrying at the same speed cannot find what the first pass missed: a hover is only logged after a client → server → log round trip, so it is not synchronous with the mouse, and a fast sweep can cross a card without one ever being emitted. Observed live: the bot decided to play a land on nine consecutive decisions, executed none of them, passed priority every time, kept an empty board from turn 2 to turn 6 and sat there until Arena's 150-second inactivity timer expired twice. Each retry now sweeps slower and in finer steps (10px/10ms → 8px/18ms → 7px/24ms). Only a failing sweep pays for it — the loop stops the moment the target card is hovered, so a healthy hand still resolves at the original speed (measured live: 0.45–1.40s per card). Note that a sweep can also fail for a reason no pacing fixes: see "Arena's Unity 6 update" below
- Hover lines are read only from log entries that actually describe a hover. A game-state message is packed with object ids and describes no hover at all, yet the old parser fell through to a generic nested search and then a regex over the whole line, so the scan could adopt an unrelated object as "the card under the cursor" and clear its cast suppression. Note that seat filtering is deliberately *not* attempted: the incoming hover shape carries two complementary seat fields and which one identifies the player doing the hovering could not be established from the logs, while a filter with the polarity inverted would discard the bot's own hovers and keep only the opponent's — turning an intermittent failure into a permanent one. It is safe to leave open because instance ids are unique per game, so a foreign id can never match the card being looked for; the sweep simply continues. Measured over a 21 MB `Player.log`, every one of the 1382 bare `"objectId"` hover fragments — the shape behind roughly 97% of identifications — originates in an *outgoing* client message, i.e. the local player's own hover
- A second copy of a legendary permanent already on our board is never cast. The action is legal, so Magic Arena offers it and the AI used to pick it — and then the client raises its own "Are You Sure?" confirm, which no game message announces. Observed live: the cast never lands, the hand sweep retries three times, `_dismiss_are_you_sure_if_present` answers No (the right default for a question the bot did not understand, so the loop cannot resolve itself), and the card is finally written off as unreachable although it was in hand the whole time — around 20 seconds of the inactivity timer per decision. Confirming would be no better: the copy resolves and the legend rule immediately bins one of the two, leaving the same board and a card fewer. The check needs no card database — the game state carries `superTypes` on the objects themselves (on hand objects too, not just battlefield ones) and matches the copies on `name`, which is a title id shared by every printing of a card, so an older reprint of a legend is still recognised where a grpId comparison would miss it. It fails open in both directions that matter: an unknown battlefield zone or a card with no supertype information means "cast it", because refusing a second Llanowar Elves, or refusing every cast on the turns Arena has not re-declared its battlefield zone, would cost far more than the loop being avoided. Known gap: land plays go through a separate path that never sees the board, so a duplicate legendary *land* is still cast — no starter or precon deck the bot farms contains one
- Modal card windows are handled: the library browser from "search your library for …" (e.g. Circuitous Route) and the card-ordering window that follows it. The bot reads how many cards it may take and which ones are legal straight from the game's own request — Magic Arena pre-filters the browser to valid choices, so it takes the required number and confirms. Everything behind such a window is unreachable, so while one is open no other move is attempted; previously the bot hunted the hand row for a card it could not click and idled until the game was conceded. The result is verified against the client's own response, and a partial answer is logged as an error rather than passing silently.
- Arena's "Report a Player" dialog is detected and **cancelled** whenever the queue stalls. It is not a game prompt and no game message announces it, so the bot is blind to it: while it is up every screen probe fails in silence. It happened three times over 2026-08-21/22; on the last one it opened on a match-end screen and the queue loop clicked Play into it for 28 minutes, with a won match sitting unclaimed behind it. That time there was no logged click for six minutes beforehand, so the trigger is unknown and guarding a click path would not have helped — which is why this net is keyed on the symptom instead: when the queue loop has ticked for 90 seconds without a match starting, it probes once per interval. The stall alone would be survivable; what makes it worth a dedicated check is the **Submit Report** button next to Cancel, pointed at a real player. Only Cancel is ever clicked: the dialog is confirmed by its title template before anything is clicked at all, the button is searched for in a band that ends at x=1000 while Submit starts near x=988 and is 285px wide (so no match for it can fit), and the fallback is the measured Cancel position (797, 875), never an absolute desktop click. Nothing but that title-gated dialog is probed on this path, because it runs on Home where a false-positive match on any other button template would click into the live UI. Both templates cross-validate against a second incident's capture at 0.99 (title) and 0.96 (button), well above the 0.80 threshold. A finished match counts as progress and restarts the stall clock — without that the probe fired once after *every* match, measured live on 2026-08-25 three times running and each time exactly 30.02s after the match ended, because the post-match flow owns those 30 seconds and the queue loop does not tick through them. It clicked nothing on any of the three (the title gate held, which is the property the net is built around), but it cost a screen search in the middle of the reward claim, and a net that cries wolf once per match is a net nobody reads

> **Rolled back on 2026-08-23 to the 1.2.1 behaviour of the click path.** Between 1.2.1 and 1.3.0 the hand-sweep, blind-sweep recovery, window-activation, Home-tab guard, target-click diagnostic and Report-a-Player detection landed as roughly 1700 changed lines in one file, and play got measurably worse: matches lost to the rope, Arena's library viewer opening by itself, and combats where the bot stood still. None of it was isolated enough to bisect against a live game, so that whole group is back at its 1.2.1 state, while the changes outside the click path are kept — the legend rule, the verified combat submit, the two-pass account rotation, the serialised screen capture, the Linux credential paste, the PC shutdown and the health check. The problems those reverted fixes described are therefore open again; each one has to come back on its own, with a session of watching behind it, not as a block.
>
> **Back since 2026-08-25:** the Report-a-Player detection, as the first of the group to return on its own. It was the only purely additive one of the six — it changed no existing click behaviour, so it cannot be what made play worse — and it comes back with only its queue-stall hook, outside the click path entirely. Its second, in-match hook hung off the blind-sweep recovery, which is still reverted; if that path ever returns, the in-match hook returns with it.

### Combat

`AI/Utilities/CombatLogic.py` decides both halves of combat, but only one half is allowed to move the mouse. Every choice is made from Magic Arena's own request rather than from our own reading of the rules: `DeclareAttackersReq` lists exactly which creatures may attack, and `DeclareBlockersReq` hands over the complete legal blocker-to-attacker graph — so flying, menace, "can't block" and summoning sickness never have to be worked out here, and a block that is offered is a block that is legal.

**Attacking: the bot swings with everything, deliberately.** This is not a gap waiting to be filled. The bot exists to farm gold, and the measured numbers say attacking selectively would cost gold rather than earn it. Replaying real `Player.log` files through the selective logic showed it would decline to attack at all on 31% of combats (20% even in the narrowest version, which only holds back a creature that dies to an available block for nothing). Meanwhile the match records say a *lost* match takes longer than a won one — 308s against 285s median — so the thing that hurts throughput is a match that will not end, and holding creatures back is exactly what stops matches ending. The logic also assumes the opponent always blocks optimally, which real opponents frequently do not, so it declines attacks that would in fact have connected. `choose_attackers` is kept, and still logs what it would have done, so the decision can be revisited if selection ever becomes cheap enough to be worth it.

**Blocking: the bot blocks.** Two passes. First the blocks that are good on their own terms — kill the attacker and survive, soak damage for free, or trade evenly or up. Then, only if the damage still coming through would be lethal, it keeps adding blocks until it is not, chumping if that is all that is left. It never spends more creatures than survival actually needs. On the same replay, 72% of block prompts would have produced a block and two otherwise-lethal attacks would have been survived, at a cost of 0.78 assignments per match. Live, across 41 matches, the win rate rose from 17% to 27% — but matches also got longer, and wins became slower than losses rather than faster, which reverses the throughput assumption the attacking decision above was built on. Blocking buys survival, and survival is what makes a match run long. Any future change that makes the bot block *more* has to be measured in gold per hour before it is believed.

Blocking is **on**; switch it off with `MTGA_COMBAT_BLOCKS=0` if a session misbehaves. The first live sessions found the weak point, and it was not the one expected. Magic Arena uses a single bottom-right button for "pass priority" and for "No Blocks", and the ordinary decision loop presses it whenever it has nothing to do — so while a block was still being clicked out, that loop would reach past it and submit an empty block step, and combat damage resolved before a single blocker had been assigned. On ordinary turns every block still landed; on turns where the incoming attack was lethal almost none did, because that is when the prompts come thick enough to lose the race, and three matches the blocking logic had already solved were lost that way. Deciding to block now mutes that button until the blocks are submitted. The mute expires on its own, so a block that goes wrong can never leave the bot unable to pass priority for the rest of the match. Finding the creatures needs no new machinery: the attackers were expected to slide off the opponent's row into the middle of the board during the declare-blockers step, and measuring twelve real captures showed they simply do not. They edge forward but stay inside the opponent's scan region, and our blockers ride up but stay inside ours, so blocking reuses both. Every block prompt still writes a `runtime/debug/declare-block-*` bundle (board capture plus the decision and the regions in play, capped at 12 per session) whether or not blocking is enabled; set `MTGA_COMBAT_BLOCK_CAPTURE=0` to stop it.

When blocking runs, each block is clicked out as blocker-then-attacker and the bottom-right button submits afterwards. The whole sequence is on a 12-second budget and every failure path — a creature that cannot be found, a scan that runs long, an exception — still presses that button, because an unassigned blocker only costs a block whereas a combat that never submits costs the rope and then the match.

> Fixed in this version: that submit press is now confirmed instead of repeated on a stopwatch. Magic Arena needs **two** presses of the same button — the first declares, the second submits — and it animates the creatures in between, swallowing anything clicked during the animation. The old code slept a fixed 0.6–1.0s and pressed again blind, which fails invisibly: the click is in our log, the game never saw it. Measured across one session on 2026-08-23: **26 logged `DeclareBlockersReq` against 2 `SubmitBlockersReq`**, the blocker timer at 0.0s combat after combat, three matches lost — one of them while ahead on life. Two separate causes. First, by the time the bot presses, Arena has usually *already* asked with `canSubmitAttackers=true` (measured: 3.4s before the click), so waiting for a *new* declaration timed out on the most common case there is; the submit acknowledgement is now awaited first and verified, and a "No Blocks" that only needs one press is recognised rather than pressed on into the next step. Second, `all_attack()` ran **twice concurrently** — the second press landing 0.46–0.48s behind the first, straight into the animation. The earlier post-mortem read that spacing as a designed retry; it was a parallel invocation, and on one decision three separate threads pressed. A lock now makes the second one a no-op. The whole sequence stays under the 8-second decision heartbeat on purpose, because overrunning it makes the heartbeat re-enter this path and rebuild exactly that concurrency.

> Also fixed: the click log used to lie about this. It was written once by the caller *before* the sequence ran, so it recorded a click for a sequence the lock then skipped, and said nothing about the extra presses that really happened. Every press now logs itself — retries and the blind fallback with their own label — and the last clicks are copied into the `runtime/debug/hand-select-*` bundle, so "what was clicked just before the board got covered" travels with the evidence instead of having to be reconstructed afterwards.

Both decisions are also written to `runtime/logs/bot.log` as `COMBAT_SHADOW` lines and attached to the matching decision snapshot under `extra.combat_shadow`, with the numbers behind them (life totals, incoming damage, what would have been left unblocked). Card data is read from the local database only — a combat decision never waits on a network call — and the computation is wrapped so that a failure inside it cannot stop the bot from declaring no blocks and moving on. Disable the logging with `MTGA_COMBAT_SHADOW=0`.

## Architecture

The codebase is split into clearly separated layers:

```
ui.py / run_bot.py          ← Entry points (UI or CLI)
        │
        ▼
    Game.py                 ← Session manager: connects Controller and AI,
                              handles match lifecycle (start → end → restart)
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   ▼         ▼
Controller   DummyAI        ← AI decides what to play (generate_move / generate_keep)
   │
   ├── LogReader            ← Reads Player.log continuously, parses GRE messages
   ├── state_machine        ← Tracks bot state: HOME / IN_GAME / PLAY_MENU / ...
   ├── actions              ← Declarative action specs (navigate, click, verify)
   ├── vision               ← Screen capture (mss) + template matching (OpenCV)
   │    └── window_locator  ← Finds the MTGA window (Win32 / xwininfo / anchor search)
   └── input_controller     ← Sends mouse/keyboard input (pyautogui / pynput / ydotool)
```

**Key design principle:** `Player.log` is the primary state source — the bot reads what MTGA reports rather than inferring state from screenshots. Vision is used only to verify that clicks landed and to locate buttons when coordinates are uncertain.

> Fixed in this version: a line of `Player.log` is only read once MTGA has finished writing it. One line carries *several* GRE messages and can be tens of kilobytes — 27804 characters and nine messages in the case that cost a match on 2026-08-23, 56 KB elsewhere — so the write is not atomic and `readline()` returned the first 3996 characters of it. That fragment matched the game-state pattern, became the newest line for it and then failed to parse, taking every message behind the tear with it: here the `ActionsAvailableReq` that passed the turn back to the bot. MTGA had nothing further to write, because it was waiting for the bot, so nothing arrived to correct the picture: for 16 seconds the bot believed it was still turn 6 with the opponent to act and a spell on the stack, while the real game sat in the bot's turn 7 main phase with the bot's own clock running. From the outside that is indistinguishable from a freeze. An unterminated line is now buffered until its terminator arrives, and only released unparsed after five seconds of complete silence — measured from the last data, not from the start of the line, so a slow write that is still making progress is never cut open, while a genuinely last line (MTGA exiting mid-write) is still not swallowed. The same tear had a second entrance: seeking to the end of the log can land *inside* a line being written, and that tail arrives newline-terminated, looking whole while starting mid-JSON — the first line after the seek is therefore discarded unless it starts like a real one. Both cases say so in the log (`LOG_LINE_UNTERMINATED`, `LOG_LINE_TAIL_DISCARDED`) and the watchdog counts them as `log_line_torn`; before this they were completely invisible.

**Card data** (`AI/Utilities/CardInfo.py`) is loaded from a local export of MTGA's own card database and delta-synced with the Scryfall API for missing entries. Cards Scryfall does not have at all — Arena-only tokens, Alchemy rebalances — are remembered as such and not requested again for 30 days, and the whole startup sync is capped at 10 seconds, so an unreachable Scryfall cannot stall the start. A card that a later Arena update ships locally is dropped from the retry list without a request.

Both `Controller` and `AI` follow an interface pattern (`ControllerInterface.py` / `AIInterface.py`) that decouples `Game.py` from the concrete implementations — making it straightforward to swap in a different AI or add a non-MTGA controller.

## Logs & Troubleshooting

| File | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `bot.log` | `runtime/logs/bot.log` | Main bot debug log |
| `snapshots.jsonl` / `board.txt` | `runtime/debug/matches/<utc>_<matchId>/` | Per-decision game-state snapshots (see below) |
| `clicks.jsonl` | `runtime/debug/clicks.jsonl` | Per-click verification log (see below) |
| `Player.log` | Auto-detected per OS (see below) | MTGA game log — primary state source |

`Player.log` default paths:
- **Windows**: `C:/Users/<YourUser>/AppData/LocalLow/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA/Player.log`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA/Player.log`
- **Linux/Proton**: `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2141910/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA/Player.log`

If auto-detection fails, the UI prompts for a manual file selection on startup.

### Is it still working? (`tools/health_check.py`)

```
.venv/Scripts/python.exe tools/health_check.py
```

One screenful, strictly read-only, safe to run mid-match. Written for watching a
long unattended run, where the newest log line is a bad witness: a bot stuck in a
retry loop writes plenty of lines while achieving nothing, and a frozen one writes
none at all — both read as "running". So it prints the three things that actually
decide whether to intervene: **how long ago** it last decided and last clicked,
what it has **achieved** (matches, wins, gold per account, account rotation), and
a **count per failure signature** — because the count over time is what separates
known flakiness that self-heals from something new and escalating.

When something goes wrong the bot saves debug bundles under `runtime/debug/<timestamp>/` containing screenshots, the log tail, and a state dump. The entire `runtime/` tree is gitignored.

`MTGA_RUNTIME_DIR` moves that whole tree — logs, debug bundles, records, status, card cache — somewhere else, which is how the test suite stops writing into the live bot's artefacts. It used to: one suite run put around a thousand lines of fixture output ("CAST_FAILED: card 999 …") into `runtime/analysis/history.log` while a real match was being played, and truncated `runtime/logs/bot.log`, because the tests build real Controllers and a Controller's constructor resets the status file. Those artefacts are the first thing you read when debugging live behaviour, so polluting them costs exactly when it matters. The catch found while fixing it: `bot_logger` resolved its log path once, into a module constant at import time, and is pulled in transitively before any test code runs — so the override could not reach it and the redirect silently did nothing for the biggest offender. Runtime paths are therefore resolved per call, never frozen at import, and `tests/test_runtime_isolation.py` asserts it by writing a real log line and checking the repo's `bot.log` was not touched.

### Decision snapshots

For post-mortem debugging of *play* decisions (why did the bot pass, attack, or pick that target?), the bot records one structured snapshot per decision under `runtime/debug/matches/<utc>_<matchId>/`:

- `snapshots.jsonl` — one JSON record per decision: turn/phase, both life totals, your and the opponent's permanents (name + power/toughness + tapped/attacking), your hand, the stack, the available actions, and the move the bot chose (`"exception"` if the decision crashed). Covered decision points include the main play decision plus mulligans, target selection, declare-blockers, pay-costs, casting-time (kicker/modal) choices, scry/surveil, and modal "choose one" prompts (each tagged with a `decision_kind`).
- `board.txt` — the same records rendered human-readable, one block per decision.
- `match.json` — per-match header/footer with the result and any card IDs that couldn't be resolved to names offline.

Card names are resolved from the local card database only (no network calls on the decision path), so this never delays in-game actions. Recording is on by default and writes only per decision (a few dozen small records per match); disable it with `MTGA_DEBUG_SNAPSHOTS=0`, or add the full raw game-state dump to each record with `MTGA_DEBUG_FULL_STATE=1`. Old match directories are pruned automatically (newest 30 kept).

### Click verification log

For debugging the *visual* layer (bot clicked the wrong screen position, or the right position at the wrong time), every mouse click is logged as one line in `runtime/debug/clicks.jsonl`: the purpose, the coordinates, the arena-mapping `source`, how old the arena-window fix was (`region_age_sec`), a `risky` flag (set when the arena window was lost and the click fell back to a blind absolute desktop coordinate), and a `decision_seq` that ties the click back to the game-state snapshot that caused it. The same context is appended to the `[CLICK]` lines in `bot.log`. On by default; disable with `MTGA_DEBUG_CLICKS=0`. The file rotates at ~5 MB (one `.1` backup kept).

The per-failure debug bundles under `runtime/debug/` (screenshots + state for mulligan/hand-select/navigation/etc.) are now capped automatically (oldest pruned, newest 60 kept) and their full-screen captures are saved as JPEG, so the debug folder no longer grows unbounded.

### Window focus during a hand sweep

To play a card the bot sweeps the mouse across the hand and waits for MTGA to log a hover; when that never arrives it gives up with `SCAN_STOPPED: No hover update before bounds` and the card is not played. Unity delivers no hover events to an *unfocused* window, so a lost foreground looks exactly like a hand that cannot be found.

`focus_mtga_window()` calls `SetForegroundWindow`, but Windows silently refuses a foreground steal from a background process (it returns 0, no exception) — and the function reports success either way, so the bot cannot tell the two cases apart. That is measured, not fixed:

- `bot.log` gets `FOCUS_MTGA_NOT_FOREGROUND: SetForegroundWindow returned …, foreground is hwnd=… title='…'` whenever the focus did not actually land on MTGA. Only the failure is logged (this runs on every cast attempt), so any occurrence is worth reading.
- each `hand-select-*` debug bundle now carries `mtga_foreground` (`hwnd`, `title`, `is_mtga`) captured at the moment the sweep gave up.

A `SCAN_STOPPED` together with `is_mtga: false` means the sweep never reached the game at all. Note that clicking into another window while the bot plays is enough to cause this.

Measured across 31 such failures: focus was **never** the cause (`is_mtga: true` in all 31). The mean brightness of the hand zone in each bundle's `arena_region.png` splits them into three groups instead, and two have a known cause that the bot now clears:

| brightness | share | cause |
|---|---|---|
| 2.8–4.4 | 5/31 | Arena's "Report a Player" dialog, open mid-match |
| 16–31 | 5/31 | a card-selection overlay (e.g. a graveyard browser opened by a "sacrifice a creature" cost) left open, Done unanswered |
| 68–104 | 21/31 | board fully visible, cards on the scan line — still unexplained |

After the *first* failed sweep of a cast, the bot probes for both and clears them: `REPORT_DIALOG_DETECTED` (Cancel is clicked, never Submit) and `STRAY_DONE_DISMISSED`. Both fire only when their own template matches on screen, so a clear board costs one scan and no click. The selection overlay is otherwise invisible — it reports `casting_time_options_open: False` and logs no `CASTING_TIME_OPTION_UNANSWERED`.

A repeated `SCAN_STOPPED` does not resolve itself: after three attempts `CAST_FAILED` gives up and the turn moves on without the card, or the match dies to the 150s timer (`ResultReason_Timeout`).

The 21 unexplained failures above turned out to be the beginning of the next item.

### Arena's Unity 6 update: a warped cursor hovers nothing

On 2026-08-26 Magic Arena moved to Unity 6 (`Initialize engine version: 6000.3.14f1` in `Player.log`, up from `2022.3.62f2`; Direct3D 11 → 12) and every hover-based scan in the bot stopped identifying anything: `SCAN_STOPPED`, `HAND_SELECT_STOPPED`, `CAST_UNAVAILABLE`, and a bot that runs its mouse along the hand row all game without ever playing a card. That session's log held **0** of the bot's own hovers against 1507 in the previous session on the old client.

pynput moves the cursor on Windows with `SetCursorPos`, which teleports the pointer without producing any device input. Unity reads the mouse through Raw Input, and the new client no longer counts a teleported pointer as hovering. Counting hover lines over 12 stops on the hand row:

| | dwell 0.02s | 0.10s | 0.25s | 0.40s |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| warp (`SetCursorPos`) | 0 | 0 | 0 | **0** |
| injected motion | 0 | — | — | **8** |

`_Win32MouseMotion` in `Controller/Utilities/input_controller.py` now moves the cursor with `SendInput` instead — absolute coordinates over the virtual desktop, so pointer speed and acceleration cannot make a sweep drift, followed by a `SetCursorPos` correction so clicks still land on the exact pixel they were aimed at. It is used for movement only (clicks and keystrokes already went through `SendInput`), on Windows only, and falls back to the old warp if it cannot be set up. With it, the original 10px/0.01s sweep reports every card in the hand again, so the sweep pacing was left alone.

Two things this was *not*, both of which cost a round of investigation:

- **not the sweep speed.** An early measurement nudged the cursor with small relative `mouse_event` calls and only saw hovers above a ~0.30s dwell, which made the pacing look like the cause. Pacing the sweep down to 90px/0.35s changed nothing at all; proper absolute motion reports every card at the original speed.
- **not the log format.** The new client writes our own hovers as *outgoing* `ClientToGREUIMessage` blocks, pretty-printed across several lines, and the existing parser already reads that shape. Incoming `onHover` messages carrying an opponent's `seatIds` keep arriving throughout, which is why the log never looks empty.

Diagnosing this class of failure: check `Initialize engine version` at the top of `Player.log` before blaming bot code, and count `"objectId"` occurrences in it — a session with none of them is an input problem, not a scan problem.
