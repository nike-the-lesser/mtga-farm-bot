"""Unit tests for "which account am I logged into?".

Regression under test, from the 2026-07-27 run: the bot logged into TEUBAT at
12:11:54 and kept calling itself Affinity2004 for another hour. The identity was
resolved 3 times in six hours across ~24 real account switches, and since an
InventoryInfo balance carries no account name at all, every gold reading in
between was booked against whatever stale name happened to be current -- one row
inflated to 18700, its partner clamped to 0.

Cause: the bot threw away the one thing it was certain of (it had just typed that
account's credentials) and re-derived the identity from the log instead. The only
thing either log-side latch matches is `authenticateResponse.screenName`, which is
the MATCH-server handshake, not a login -- so right after a switch, before the
incoming account has played anything, the newest one in the tail still belongs to
the account we just left.

These tests drive the real file readers over a temp log; nothing touches MTGA.
